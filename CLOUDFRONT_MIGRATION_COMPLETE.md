- ‚úÖ **Audio Files**: All song audio files uploaded to `s3://trivia-game-media-cdn/images/songseng/`
- ‚úÖ **Question Images**: Flags, maps, and other question images uploaded

- ‚úÖ **Questions Collection**: All image URLs converted to CloudFront URLs
- ‚úÖ **Categories Collection**: All category image URLs converted to CloudFront URLs
- ‚úÖ **Migration Script**: Successfully ran `migrate-database-urls.js` to update all Firestore documents

### 3. Code Updates
- ‚úÖ **Media URL Converter**: Already configured to use CloudFront URLs (`src/utils/mediaUrlConverter.js`)
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: CloudFront configuration added to `.env` and `.env.example`
- ‚úÖ **No Firebase Storage Dependencies**: Verified no `getDownloadURL` or upload functions in use

## CloudFront Configuration

**CloudFront Domain:** `drcqcbq3desis.cloudfront.net`
**S3 Bucket:** `trivia-game-media-cdn`
**AWS Region:** `me-south-1`

## Environment Variables (Production)

Ensure these are set in your production environment:

```env
VITE_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN=drcqcbq3desis.cloudfront.net
VITE_CLOUDFRONT_ENABLED=true
VITE_CDN_BASE_URL=https://drcqcbq3desis.cloudfront.net
VITE_AWS_REGION=me-south-1
VITE_AWS_S3_BUCKET=trivia-game-media-cdn
```

## Testing Results

‚úÖ **Build**: Application builds successfully without errors
‚úÖ **CloudFront Access**: Verified media files are accessible via CloudFront URLs
‚úÖ **Database**: All Firestore URLs successfully converted
‚úÖ **Dev Server**: Running on http://localhost:5175

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Faster Load Times**: CloudFront CDN delivers media from edge locations
2. **Lower Costs**: S3 + CloudFront is more cost-effective than Firebase Storage
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced latency for users worldwide
4. **Scalability**: CloudFront handles high traffic efficiently
5. **CORS Support**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests

## Files to Keep

- `migrate-database-urls.js` - Keep for reference or rollback
- `scripts/migrateMediaToCloudFront.js` - Keep for reference
- `MIGRATION_README.md` - Keep as migration guide

## Security Reminder

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The `service-account.json` file is still present in the project root. This file should be:
1. Removed after confirming the migration is complete
2. Never committed to version control (already in .gitignore)
3. Stored securely if needed for future operations

```bash
# Remove service account file after confirming migration success
del service-account.json
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Monitor CloudFront Metrics**: Check AWS CloudFront dashboard for usage stats
2. **Test on Production**: Deploy and verify all media loads correctly
3. **Firebase Storage Cleanup**: Consider removing old files from Firebase Storage (after confirming everything works)
4. **Documentation**: Update team documentation with new media upload procedures

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise, you can rollback by:
1. Keeping Firebase URLs in the database (migration script can be reversed)
2. The code still supports Firebase URLs as fallback
3. Contact the team lead before making any rollback decisions
