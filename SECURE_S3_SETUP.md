# Secure S3 Upload Setup - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

You now have a **secure server-side S3 upload system** that keeps your AWS credentials safe!

### Architecture

```
Before (INSECURE):
Client (Browser) ‚Üí S3 (with exposed AWS credentials)
‚ùå AWS credentials visible in JavaScript
‚ùå Anyone can steal your keys

After (SECURE):
Client ‚Üí Firebase Function ‚Üí S3
‚úÖ AWS credentials on server only
‚úÖ Admin-only access control
‚úÖ No credentials exposed to users
```

---

## üöÄ What's Been Done

### 1. Firebase Functions Created

Three new secure functions have been deployed:

- **`s3Upload`** - Uploads files to S3 (admin-only)
- **`s3Delete`** - Deletes files from S3 (admin-only)
- **`imageProxy`** - Proxies images to bypass CORS (existing)

**Function URLs:**
- Upload: `https://us-central1-lamah-357f3.cloudfunctions.net/s3Upload`
- Delete: `https://us-central1-lamah-357f3.cloudfunctions.net/s3Delete`

### 2. AWS Credentials Secured

Your AWS credentials are now stored as Firebase Secrets:
```
‚úÖ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (secret)
‚úÖ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (secret)
```

These are **never exposed** to clients, only accessible by Firebase Functions.

### 3. New Secure Client Service

Created `src/utils/s3UploadSecure.js` - a new client-side service that:
- ‚úÖ Uses Firebase Functions for uploads (no exposed credentials)
- ‚úÖ Requires authentication (admin-only)
- ‚úÖ Supports images, audio, and video
- ‚úÖ Returns CloudFront URLs

---

## üìù How to Use

### Option 1: Use Secure Service (Recommended for Production)

Import the secure service in your components:

```javascript
import S3UploadServiceSecure from '../utils/s3UploadSecure.js'

// Upload an image
const file = event.target.files[0]
const url = await S3UploadServiceSecure.uploadQuestionImage(file, questionId)
console.log('Uploaded:', url)

// Upload media (audio/video)
const url = await S3UploadServiceSecure.uploadQuestionMedia(file, questionId)

// Delete a file
await S3UploadServiceSecure.deleteFile(url)
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Works in production deployments
- ‚úÖ AWS credentials never exposed
- ‚úÖ Admin-only access control
- ‚úÖ Secure by design

### Option 2: Use Old Service (Local Development Only)

The old service (`s3Upload.js`) still works but **only locally** with credentials in `.env`:

```javascript
import S3UploadService from '../utils/s3Upload.js'

// This ONLY works if you have VITE_AWS_* in your .env file
const url = await S3UploadService.uploadQuestionImage(file, questionId)
```

**Note:** This service will show a deprecation warning and won't work in production.

## üîÑ Migration Guide

If you have existing code using the old `S3UploadService`, here's how to migrate:

### Before (Insecure):
```javascript
import S3UploadService from '../utils/s3Upload.js'

const url = await S3UploadService.uploadImage(file, 'images/questions', 'image.jpg')
```

### After (Secure):
```javascript
import S3UploadServiceSecure from '../utils/s3UploadSecure.js'

const url = await S3UploadServiceSecure.uploadImage(file, 'images/questions', 'image.jpg')
```

**That's it!** The API is identical, just change the import.

---

## üß™ Testing

To test the secure upload system:

1. **Make sure you're logged in as admin**
2. **Try uploading an image in the admin panel**
3. **Check browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   Uploading file to S3 via Firebase Function: images/questions/question_xxx.jpg
   Upload completed successfully: https://drcqcbq3desis.cloudfront.net/...
   ```

4. **Verify in S3** - Check your S3 bucket to confirm the file was uploaded

---

## üîê Security Benefits

### What's Protected Now:

1. **AWS Credentials** - Stored as Firebase Secrets, never in code
2. **Admin-Only Access** - Functions verify user is admin before uploading
3. **Authentication Required** - Must be logged in with valid Firebase token
4. **No Client-Side Exposure** - Credentials never sent to browser

### What You Can Do Now:

‚úÖ Deploy to GitHub without exposing AWS keys
‚úÖ Add AWS/OpenAI to GitHub Secrets (if needed)
‚úÖ Share your repository publicly
‚úÖ Let users access deployed site safely

---

## üìã Environment Variables

### For Production (GitHub Secrets):

You **no longer need** to add AWS credentials to GitHub Secrets!

They're stored in Firebase Secrets instead. You only need:

```yaml
# GitHub Secrets (.github/workflows/simple-deploy.yml)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

### For Local Development (Optional):

If you want to use the old insecure service locally, keep these in `.env`:

```bash
# .env (local development only)
VITE_AWS_REGION=me-south-1
VITE_AWS_S3_BUCKET=trivia-game-media-cdn
VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key_here
VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_here
```

**But you don't need them!** The secure service works without any VITE_AWS_* variables.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized: Missing token"
- **Solution:** Make sure you're logged in before uploading

### "Forbidden: Admin access required"
- **Solution:** Ensure your user has `isAdmin: true` in Firestore

### "AWS credentials not available"
- **Solution:** You're using the old service. Switch to `S3UploadServiceSecure`

### Upload fails with 500 error
- **Solution:** Check Firebase Functions logs:
  ```bash
  firebase functions:log
  ```
