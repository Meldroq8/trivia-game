## How to Use

### In Admin Panel (Question Editor)

1. **Write your question** in the question text field
2. **Click the "‚ú® AI" button** next to the question text
3. **Modal opens with 2 tabs**:

#### Tab 1: ÿ™ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿµ (Improve Text)
- Shows your original question
- Click "ÿ™ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ§ÿßŸÑ" (Improve Question)

- Shows explanation of why it was improved
- May suggest different difficulty level
- Click "ÿ™ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜÿßÿ™" (Apply Improvements) to accept

#### Tab 2: ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≠ÿ´ ÿπŸÜ ÿµŸàÿ± (Search Images)

- Enter custom search query (or leave empty to use question text)
- Click "üîç ÿ®ÿ≠ÿ´" (Search)
- AI generates optimized English search query (includes correct answer for better relevance)
- Shows 8 relevant images from Google
- **Click any image to select it**
- **Image is automatically downloaded via CORS proxy and uploaded to CloudFront**
- Image URL is applied to selected target (question or answer)
- Modal closes after successful upload

### Important Notes

1. **All existing features remain unchanged**:
   - Manual image upload still works
   - Inline editing still works
   - All media upload functions remain

2. **AI features are optional**:
   - You can skip AI and add questions normally
   - No requirement to use AI

3. **Images are safe**:
   - Selected images are downloaded from Google
   - Re-uploaded to YOUR S3/CloudFront
   - Stored permanently in your infrastructure
   - No external dependencies after upload

4. **Error handling**:
   - If API keys are missing, you'll see clear error messages
   - If search finds no results, you'll be notified
   - If upload fails, you can retry

## Cost Breakdown

### OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini
- **Cost**: ~$0.15 per 1M input tokens
- **Per question**: ~$0.0001 (practically free)
- **100 questions**: ~$0.01

### Google Custom Search
- **Free tier**: 100 searches/day
- **Paid tier**: $5 per 1,000 queries after free tier
- **Recommendation**: Free tier is usually enough

### Total Cost
- **Very minimal** - likely under $1/month for typical usage

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Make sure you added `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env`
- Make sure the key starts with `sk-`
- Restart dev server after adding

### "Google Search API not configured"
- Make sure you added both `VITE_GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` and `VITE_GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`
- Verify Custom Search API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Restart dev server

### "ŸÑŸÖ Ÿäÿ™ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ´Ÿàÿ± ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿµŸàÿ±" (No images found)
- Try different search keywords
- Check if your search engine has "Search the entire web" enabled
- Verify "Image Search" is enabled in search engine settings

### Image upload fails
- Check S3 credentials are correct
- Verify CORS is configured on S3 bucket
- Check browser console for detailed error
- If CORS errors persist, the system uses a proxy service (allorigins.win)

### CORS errors when downloading images
- The system automatically uses a CORS proxy service to download external images
- If proxy fails, try selecting a different image
- Some websites may block automated downloads

## Security Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - it contains your API keys
2. **Use `.env.example`** as a template
3. **API keys are only in frontend** - consider moving to backend/Firebase Functions for production
4. **Rate limiting** - Google has daily limits on free tier

## Alternative: Backend Implementation

For better security in production, consider:
1. Creating Firebase Cloud Functions
2. Calling OpenAI/Google APIs from the backend
3. Exposing secure endpoints to your frontend
4. This keeps API keys server-side only

Contact developer for backend implementation if needed.
